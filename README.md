# The Josephus Problem
A famous (albeit morbid) problem from history. You may read more about it at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem

The starter code for this project is available at: https://github.com/Pingry-DS/Josephus-StarterCode

## The easier problem
Solve the original Josephus problem where each soldier kills the soldier after him. Given a number of soldiers in the circle, tell me which soldier survives.

To run your program:
```
java EasyJoe 45
```
The number of soldiers must be specified as a command line argument, and the surviving soldier's number must be printed to the screen.

## The harder problem
The soldiers agree to instead kill the soldier directly across the circle. If two soldiers are across the circle, the one on the left (from the perspective of the killer) is killed. The other rules remain unchanged.

To run your program:
```
java HardJoe 45
```
Again, the number of soldiers must be specified as a command line argument, and the surviving soldier's number must be printed to the screen.

## The streetcred

You earn the streetcred if your group solves the problem for the highest number of soldiers. In order to steal the streetcred from another group, you must solve the problem for at least twice as many soldiers as they did.

### Right now
Two streetcred will be given for this activity in the near future; one for each problem. That streetcred will not be stealable again in the future.

### Ongoing
To streetcred will be given for this activity on an ongoing basis; one for each problem. That streetcred can be stolen at any point during the course.
